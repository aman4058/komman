You then get tested upon the completion of each assignment via a questionnaire which you can fill in and return through email, fax or good old snail mail.<\/p>\r\n<p>The course offers two payment options. US and Canada based students are charged $695 and can either Pay Full or Pay As You Go. Paying in full for the 18 assignments also gives you a discount of $200, meaning you pay $495 for the entire course. The second option allows you to pay for one assignment at a time and costs $200 for enrollment and the first assignment. The rest are purchased at $40 each.<\/p>\r\n<p>International students are charged $795, but again, paying in full gives comes with a discount of $180, reducing the total to $610. The Pay As You Go option has a $300 enrollment fee; future assignments are purchased at $40 each.<\/p>\r\n\t<p>Weddings Beautiful is an established player in the wedding planning business, offering certification since 1968. It was founded by Gary Wright who aimed at providing excellence in education and offer support to hopeful wedding planners on a global scale.<\/p>\r\n<p>The two certification courses they offer are Certified Wedding Specialist and Certified Wedding Planner.<\/p>\r\n<\/div><!-- .vgblk-rw-wrapper -->","excerpt":"<p>Working from home meant we could vary snack and coffee breaks, change our desks or
