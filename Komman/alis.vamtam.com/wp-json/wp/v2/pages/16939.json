An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https:\/\/automattic.com\/privacy\/.

Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.<\/p>\n<p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.<\/p>\n<h3>Analytics &#8211; Who we share your data with<\/h3>\n<p>If you request a password reset, your IP address will be included in the reset email.<\/p>\n<h3>How long we retain your data<\/h3>\n<p>If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.<\/p>\n<p>For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.<\/p>\n<h3>What rights you have over your data<\/h3>\n<p>If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us.
