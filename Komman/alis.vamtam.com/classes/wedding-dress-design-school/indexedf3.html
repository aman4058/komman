SUMMARY:Wedding Dress Design School
DESCRIPTION:Event description\n	\n	Essential Information\nWedding dress design programs are commonly part of a larger area of study known as fashion design. Prospective students may pursue associate’s or bachelor’s degrees in fashion design. These programs can train students to fashion couture wedding dresses and other formal attire for diverse clientele. Both associate’s and bachelor’s programs include a combination of studio design classes\, lecture-based sessions and final projects. Admission to some programs may require a portfolio of relevant design work.\n\n	Programme structure\n	\n	An associate’s degree program in fashion design introduces students to foundational fashion principles\, such as drawing\, textiles\, industrial sewing mechanics and visual merchandising. Students hone their technical skills with fellow classmate designers in studio-style classrooms\, where they learn how to choose appropriate fabrics and textiles for each wedding or couture dress\, operate industrial-style sewing and pressing equipment and learn about mass-production manufacturing that produces affordable gowns. \n	Applicants to an associate’s degree program for wedding dress designers must have a high school diploma or GED as well as a portfolio that demonstrates artistic proficiency. Applicants may also need to participate in a personal interview. Once admitted\, these programs require students to complete a professional fashion design portfolio prior to graduation. Students also participate in the following fashion design courses: \n\nRetail merchandising\nFashion design and illustration\nRendering and pattern development\nIndustrial sewing equipment and techniques
