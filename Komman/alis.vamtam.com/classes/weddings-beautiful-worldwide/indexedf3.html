You then get tested upon the completion of each assignment via a questionnaire which you can fill in and return through email\, fax or good old snail mail. \nThe course offers two payment options. US and Canada based students are charged $695 and can either Pay Full or Pay As You Go. Paying in full for the 18 assignments also gives you a discount of $200\, meaning you pay $495 for the entire course. The second option allows you to pay for one assignment at a time and costs $200 for enrollment and the first assignment. The rest are purchased at $40 each. \nInternational students are charged $795\, but again\, paying in full gives comes with a discount of $180\, reducing the total to $610.
