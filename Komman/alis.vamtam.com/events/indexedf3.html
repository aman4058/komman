SUMMARY:Wedding Dress Design School
DESCRIPTION:Event description\n	\n	Essential Information\nWedding dress design programs are commonly part of a larger area of study known as fashion design. Prospective students may pursue associate’s or bachelor’s degrees in fashion design. These programs can train students to fashion couture wedding dresses and other formal attire for diverse clientele. Both associate’s and bachelor’s programs include a combination of studio design classes\, lecture-based sessions and final projects. Admission to some programs may require a portfolio of relevant design work.\n\n	Programme structure\n	\n	An associate’s degree program in fashion design introduces students to foundational fashion principles\, such as drawing\, textiles\, industrial sewing mechanics and visual merchandising. Students hone their technical skills with fellow classmate designers in studio-style classrooms\, where they learn how to choose appropriate fabrics and textiles for each wedding or couture dress\, operate industrial-style sewing and pressing equipment and learn about mass-production manufacturing that produces affordable gowns. \n	Applicants to an associate’s degree program for wedding dress designers must have a high school diploma or GED as well as a portfolio that demonstrates artistic proficiency. Applicants may also need to participate in a personal interview. Once admitted\, these programs require students to complete a professional fashion design portfolio prior to graduation. Students also participate in the following fashion design courses: \n\nRetail merchandising\nFashion design and illustration\nRendering and pattern development\nIndustrial sewing equipment and techniques

SUMMARY:Conclusion
DESCRIPTION:Event description\n	\n	In the end\, all three wedding planner courses are very reputable and well-received\, so you can’t go wrong with any of the three. Most prospective wedding planners will take price into consideration\, and it’s not hard to understand why. But I urge anyone who is considering wedding planning courses to physically call or visit the offices of these organizations and get a feel for what kind of care and attention you’ll be receiving. It’s not altogether different from college applications\, just on a smaller scale. \n	◎ Review plant layout requirements for single and multiple units\n◎ Learn about associated control panels and operation\n◎ Comprehend the testing and commissioning procedures\n◎ Understand plant performance troubleshooting techniques\n◎ Learn and apply good maintenance practices\n	Whichever course you eventually choose\, remember to have fun along the way and get to know as many people as possible. After all\, most graduating students report that the contacts you make were just as important as the nitty gritty lessons you learned throughout your schooling. \n	◎ Understand the principles of combustion processes and engine operation\n◎ Differentiate between the types and applications of diesel power generating plants\n◎ Understand fuel and lube oil requirements\n◎ Comprehend ISO ratings and terminologies\n◎ Explain the various engine components and their functions\n◎ Understand the generator principles and construction
