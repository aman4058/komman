One of the things we noticed when talking to the designers themselves was how much the industry works to improve upon gowns inspired by what brides really want and by extension then what their sisters and friends want too. Also practicality! \u2013 We were lucky enough to chat with head designer at Justin Alexander, Tony Mental who expressed real forward thinking in terms of functionality in developed dress linings for benefit of shape and equally comfort. Whether a structured or a streamlined dress, gowns are desired to look flawless and feel every bit as good to wear.\r\n\r\nHere we share with you the BEST bits from the Harrogate Bridal show including dresses, designers and award winners of 2016 \u2013 all from the eyes of Wedding Ideas!
