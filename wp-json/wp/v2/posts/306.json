Destination weddings are for bridechillas only.\n\t<\/h2>\n<h3>\n\t@Wedding\n\t<\/h3>\n\t<p>Control freaks\/type-As\/people who had their weddings planned out before they met their fianc\u00e9, hear me when I say you don&#8217;t want a destination wedding. Disaster is inevitable. You will forget to pack something v. important and leave it at home. You will try on a dress you had tailored and realize it doesn\u2019t fit right \u2014 and not be able to find a tailor on your remote island to fix it. Someone\u2019s flight will be delayed or canceled. A checked bag will get lost. I can assure you, something out of your control will happen! This is the case for any wedding but especially when you&#8217;re dealing with weather you might not be used to, an area you may be unfamiliar with, and the stresses of traveling. So yeah, chill brides only.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/alis.vamtam.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/face2.jpg\" alt=\"face2\" \/>\n<h2>\n\t2. You won&#8217;t be able to invite everyone you want\n\t<\/h2>\n<h3>\n\t@Wedding\n\t<\/h3>\n\t<p>You can&#8217;t have a destination wedding without embracing the fact that some of your favorite people won&#8217;t be able to swing it due to the expense or the time off or whatever the reason. But a surprising number of people will make it out, and you&#8217;ll have the best time with them. If it&#8217;s important to you that every person you&#8217;ve ever met and your dog be in your bridal party, keep your location within driving distance. But in the end, the only two people who matter for being there are you and your soon-to-be spouse.<\/p>\n<\/div><!-- .vgblk-rw-wrapper -->","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Only bridechillas allowed.
